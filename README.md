#  Portfolio Optimization (Markowitz Model)
>  **[WORK IN PROGRESS]** This project is currently under development.

##  Project Overview
This project implements the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) introduced by Harry Markowitz. The goal is to mathematically analyze a universe of financial assets to construct an "Efficient Frontier" and identify the optimal investment portfolio that maximizes expected returns for a given level of risk.

##  Tech Stack (Planned)
* Python
* SciPy (Optimization routines)
* Pandas & NumPy
* Matplotlib / Plotly (Interactive charts)

##  To-Do List
- [x] Outline the mathematical approach.
- [ ] Fetch historical asset data (equities, bonds, etc.).
- [ ] Calculate expected returns and the covariance matrix.
- [ ] Implement optimization algorithms to find the Efficient Frontier.
- [ ] Plot the Efficient Frontier and highlight the optimal Sharpe Ratio.
- [ ] Document the mathematical theory behind the code.
